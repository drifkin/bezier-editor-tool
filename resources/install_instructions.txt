How to install tool ##tool.name##


Install with the "Add Tool..." tool

New for Processing 2.0: Add contributed tools by selecting "Add Tool..." 
from the Tool menu. Not all available tools have been converted to show up in 
this menu. If a tool isn't there, it will need to be installed manually by 
following the instructions below.


Manual Install

Contributed tools must be downloaded separately and manually placed within the 
"tools" folder of your Processing sketchbook. To find (and change) the 
Processing sketchbook location on your computer, open the Preferences window 
from the Processing application (PDE) and look for the "Sketchbook location" 
item at the top. 

Copy the contributed tool's folder into the "tools" folder at this location. 
You will need to create the "tools" folder if this is your first contributed 
tool. 

By default the following locations are used for your sketchbook folder:
 
  For Mac users, the sketchbook folder is located inside ~/Documents/Processing. 
  For Windows users, the sketchbook folder is located inside 
    'My Documents'/Processing.
    
The folder structure for tool ##tool.name## should be as follows:

Processing
  tools
    ##tool.name##
      examples
      tool
        ##tool.name##.jar
      reference
      src
                      
Some folders like "examples" or "src" might be missing. After tool ##tool.name##
has been successfully installed, restart the Processing application.
